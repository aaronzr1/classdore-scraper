We will read and discuss both primary sources from the period and modern scholarly studies. The capstone seminar is the culminating scholarly experience of a student's undergraduate career as a History major at Vanderbilt. The purpose of this seminar is to introduce students to historical research using primary sources and to teach them the skills of the professional historian. The main focus of this course will be on research and writing. Students will learn how to locate and use primary and secondary sources, and how to identify a viable topic, form a research question, perform the necessary research, and create an argument. Each student will then write (and re-write) a polished properly cited 20-25 page paper, due at the end of the semester. The student's choice of a topic will be an intersection of their interests and the primary sources available. I will aid students in this decision. Students may pursue their research on any part of the world, provided they can identify and read primary sources.",

Basic environmental epidemiology, use of evidence in policy and practice, along with an overview of the main environmental exposures will be explored. This course also examines an overview of public health surveillance as a lens to public health practice, in terms of how public health programs are organized, financed, and operated and what surveillance data are available to inform specific programs. Public health practitioners and policy-makers who plan, implement, and evaluate infectious disease, chronic disease, injury, and disability prevention and control programs have a need for reliable information about the status of these health problems among the populations they serve. Surveillance systems provide information for action. Analyzing, interpreting and using public health surveillance data inform the design, operation, and delivery of public health programs and target public health action and disease control. Public health surveillance is the ongoing process that public health agencies use to collect, manage, analyze, interpret and disseminate this information. We will review basic approaches to public health surveillance, including disease reporting regulations and notifiable diseases, surveillance for infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and adverse events, uses of surveillance data, and how surveillance data can inform public health program, policy, and practice. The course will be taught by a multidisciplinary group of faculty using didactic and interactive elements of instruction.",

The course fosters the development of a fundamental understanding of what attest providers do and the conceptual and practical problems they face. Such an understanding facilitates a productive interaction between valuation program alumni and their largest client - the assurance/audit service line of their own firm. The focus of the course is (1) the nature and value of external audits of corporate financial statements, (2) the structure and performance of the public accounting profession, (3) the demand for 'audit assist' engagements (AKA channel 1 services), and (4) the language attest providers use to scope 'audit assist' engagements. The emphasis throughout the course is professional judgment as opposed to off-the-shelf mechanical rules. Ever present is professional formation, and a socialization into the public accounting profession. [1]",

        "notes": "Cognitive Psychology: Foundations and Frontiers. Cognitive psychology is the foundation of all theories in psychology.  It addresses fundamental processes of attention, memory, decision making, executive control, skill, expertise, language, reasoning, and problem solving that underlie all human functioning and are shared by many non-human animals, especially primates.  These processes are the foundation of developmental psychology across the lifespan, social psychology and social cognition, and psychological and neurological disorders.  They describe the basic computations and relate them to behavioral markers, which can inform the search for brain mechanisms that implement cognition at many levels of analysis (spike trains, local field potentials, EEG, fMRI). This course will provide you with a foundation in these foundational concepts and help you link them to your own research.  We will discuss the basic concepts, theories, and computational models, and the experimental paradigms used to define them (operationally) and study them.  We will identify fundamental themes that have guided cognitive research from its inception to the present cutting edge.  Your written assignments will relate these ideas to your own research, offering you opportunities to enrich and enhance your theories and experiments.",

Many modern data science applications are highly data intensive, require heavy read/write workloads, and are often unstructured in nature, which requires storage and processing beyond relational databases and management methodologies. NoSQL, or Not-Only SQL, databases are non-schema oriented and provide additional capabilities that support these types of applications. This course will introduce NoSQL systems such as BigTable (by Google), Dynamo (by Amazon), Apache Cassandra (used by Facebook), Apache HBase (used by Twitter), and other NoSQL systems such as MongoDB. Other topics covered will include an introduction to big data analytics such as Apache Hadoop and MapReduce. [3]",

Learners will use the nursing process and introductory clinical judgment to identify person-centered and family-centered priority nursing actions to holistically prevent, manage, or improve problems within body systems. The influence of growth and development, sex, gender, psychosocial, and cultural factors on the health of individuals, families, and populations will be discussed. The roles of the nurse, patient, and family in collaborative interprofessional health care delivery, and the implications for use of clinical informatics will also be discussed.

Formal methods are mathematically rigorous techniques and tools for specifying, designing, and analyzing systems to ensure they operate correctly and meet their requirements. Representative formal methods to be studied include model checking, automated and interactive theorem proving, reachability, satisfiability, neural network verification, and abstract interpretation, along with how these may be integrated with AI systems including large language models (LLMs). Students will develop and apply formal methods in a semester long course project, which counts as the project course requirement in CS and can be used to satisfy Vanderbilt's immersion requirement.",

Every topic describes a transaction that restructures or reorganizes the firm in some particular way. The specific objectives of the course include: (1) to build a framework for analyzing various corporate restructuring transactions primarily through techniques of financial analysis; (2) to provide a broad overview of corporate restructuring approaches which can then be critically applied to solve business problems; (3) to establish an economic perspective from which to assess the corporate and social consequences of alternative corporate restructuring and reorganization techniques.

        "description": "We are clearly at a critical point regarding the ability of individuals to control their reproduction free from intervention by the state and by third parties, an issue that is highly contested in our society. Among the topics we will discuss are: 1) the variable acceptability of contraception and abortion over the years, 2) eugenics, its association with sterilization and immigration policy, and its long shadow, 3) the evolution of reproductive genetic testing from prenatal diagnosis and risk counseling to preimplantation genetic testing and non-invasive genetic testing to mitochondrial replacement therapy and the prospect of germline gene editing; and 4) the growth of assisted reproductive technology from gamete donation to gestational surrogacy. The federal government has been involved both as a potential payer as well as a regulator of medical interventions. State governments, which traditionally have been primary regulators of health care, have become much more active in controlling access in recent years, and there is every reason to think that this trend will continue. Thus, we will look at what is going on in the \"laboratory of the states\" and will study the experience in Tennessee in some detail. We will also look at the actions of third parties, such as employers. In all these domains, we will consider disparities in access and burden as they have changed over time. We will also consider the broader influences of debates about the rights and roles of women, particularly those of color, of LGBTQIA+, as well as the influence of conscientious objection. [2]",

These questions are examined within a wider context of pre-modern to early modern global history. Special attention will be given to recovering voices and perspectives lost or muted in the sources. This is the first of the two-course sequence in History of Global Christianities. The course focuses especially on two formative periods: Christian formation in Late Antiquity and again surrounding the reformations beginning in the 1500s. [3]",

This course examines the history of evangelicals in the United States from the eighteenth century to the present, focusing on their social and political activism. Numerous scholars have examined evangelicalism's diverse social and political influence on a variety of issues. Most recently, however, politicians and the news media in the United States often have more narrowly defined evangelicalism as a conservative Christian movement comprised of whites who overwhelmingly support the Republican party. How did this understanding develop and why? How accurate is this view in accounting for the complexities of evangelicalism? Also, how do we evaluate the moral claims many evangelicals have made in relation to their political loyalties and activism? This course addresses these and other questions from a historical perspective. [3] Mr. Byrd",

        "description": "Evangelicalism is influential, not only as a religious movement, but also as a political force in the United States. This course examines the history of evangelicals in the United States from the eighteenth century to the present, focusing on their social and political activism. Numerous scholars have examined evangelicalism's diverse social and political influence on a variety of issues. Most recently, however, politicians and the news media in the United States often have more narrowly defined evangelicalism as a conservative Christian movement comprised of whites who overwhelmingly support the Republican party. How did this understanding develop and why? How accurate is this view in accounting for the complexities of evangelicalism? Also, how do we evaluate the moral claims many evangelicals have made in relation to their political loyalties and activism? This course addresses these and other questions from a historical perspective. [3] Mr. Byrd",

Students will also develop core skills essential to legal advocacy, including: client interviewing and counseling; research, writing, and drafting; discovery; oral and written advocacy; negotiation; and client-centered lawyering. Critical reflection, consistent engagement with ethical rules, and examination of the role of the lawyer in a legal system and the local community will assist students in developing a professional understanding of their work.

Students will defend clients in eviction and foreclosure actions, represent them in Fair Housing claims, work with local housing authorities to protect their federally subsidized housing benefits, and negotiate settlements with private landlords. Students will also work directly with governmental and nonprofit agencies to create educational materials for tenants and homeowners and to effect state-level policy change affecting this vulnerable population. Students in the Housing Law Clinic will take primary responsibility and decision-making authority for their cases under the mentorship of the clinic faculty member. Classes will provide a strong foundation in substantive housing law, including the Federal Regulations governing public housing benefits and subsidized housing, the Fair Housing Act, and the Tennessee Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act. Classes will also be taught on substantive subjects specific to representing low-income tenants and homeowners, including the impact on housing insecurity on families and children, the lack of adequate affordable housing options in Nashville specifically, and the ways in which people of color are disproportionately impacted by evictions and foreclosures. Enrollment limited. [4]",

        "description": "The final nurse-midwifery practicum allows the student to practice full scope nurse-midwifery under the supervision of experienced Certified Nurse-Midwife preceptors, managing health care from perimenarche through menopause and newborn health care through the first month of life. Full scope nurse-midwifery care includes the areas of gynecology, preconception, antepartum, intrapartum, postpartum, newborn, breast-feeding support, and primary care of the pregnant and non-pregnant individual. Students immerse themselves in the clinical practice to which they are assigned and work in collaboration with the client and other health care providers, consulting and referring according to the nurse-midwifery management process. Academic faculty are closely involved with the selection of appropriate clinical sites and ongoing advisement and evaluation of the student during the practicum. A written comprehensive exam is taken after the practicum is completed. By the end of the course, the graduate is prepared to assume the role of the beginning professional nurse-midwife and to sit for the American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB) certification examination. The AMCB Philosophy, Code of Ethics, and Core Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice (including the Hallmarks of Midwifery and Midwifery Management Process), and the Standards for Midwifery Practice provide the framework for the course. Prerequisite: 6810, 6815, 6821, 6831, 6835, 6836, 6838. Corequisite: 6841. [5]",

However, when asked what they cherish most about their brains, most people point to subjective experience consciousness such as seeing, smelling, and feeling. In this seminar, which combines student-led talks, discussions, and guided instruction, we will explore the neuroscience of consciousness, with an emphasis on visual perception. We cover early attempts to establish mathematical laws (psychophysical equations) linking brain activity to subjective perception (qualia). We examine what is known about the neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCCs). And we discuss recent attempts at sophisticated, mathematically formalized theories, such as Integrated Information Theory and Predictive Coding, along with their empirical tests.",

        "description": "This project-based course is intended for executive MBA students seeking to improve the innovation capabilities in the complex organizations they work in.  The course presents a constraint-based model of innovation that diagnoses where innovation problems are likely to occur (i.e. at the individual, group, organizational, industry, societal, or technological level). In addition to learning how to manage innovative organizations and lead creative teams, participants will also practice improving their own creative abilities through the performance of an innovation project. While we will discuss examples of technical innovation, this is not a technology course; rather, this course is about understanding and managing people who are engaged in the process of creation, innovation and change.  Note on course logistics:  After the first in-person session, the course moves to an online distance-learning format, with all lectures, discussions, assignments, and quizzes being made available online. Teams will schedule online check-in meetings with the professor at appropriate project milestones during the course.  [2]",

Statistical consulting skills are increasingly vital for research and analytic jobs in industry, education, medicine, and academia. Yet a variety of data analysis experiences beyond formal methodological coursework are needed to hone statistical consulting skills. Students work in a mentored environment on statistical and theoretical problems confronted by applied researchers in real data analysis settings within the social sciences and education. Students work in small groups or individually on consulting projects and also have opportunities for providing constructive feedback on others' projects. Throughout, students will critically consider the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models, an to aid in statistical consulting and problem solving. Students will practice using AI to augment consulting deliverables and will critically evaluate the utility of AI for these purposes. This course will synthesize and further develop students' understanding of how to translate subject-matter questions into statistical language, select an appropriate statistical method, research and develop workable solutions to new problems, write an analysis plan, and effectively communicate results through oral and written reports, and thoughtfully use emerging technology to solve complex statistical inquiries. This course will not only focus on the content of statistical consulting but also on the process - covering how to communicate effectively, professionally, and ethically with clients about expectations, responsibilities, hypotheses, analyses, and results.

        "description": "The objective of this course is to prepare students for providing statistical consulting in collaborative applied research settings. Statistical consulting skills are increasingly vital for research and analytic jobs in industry, education, medicine, and academia. Yet a variety of data analysis experiences beyond formal methodological coursework are needed to hone statistical consulting skills. Students work in a mentored environment on statistical and theoretical problems confronted by applied researchers in real data analysis settings within the social sciences and education. Students work in small groups or individually on consulting projects and also have opportunities for providing constructive feedback on others' projects.  Throughout, students will critically consider the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically large language models, an to aid in statistical consulting and problem solving. Students will practice using AI to augment consulting deliverables and will critically evaluate the utility of AI for these purposes. This course will synthesize and further develop students' understanding of how to translate subject-matter questions into statistical language, select an appropriate statistical method, research and develop workable solutions to new problems, write an analysis plan, and effectively communicate results through oral and written reports, and thoughtfully use emerging technology to solve complex statistical inquiries. This course will not only focus on the content of statistical consulting but also on the process - covering how to communicate effectively, professionally, and ethically with clients about expectations, responsibilities, hypotheses, analyses, and results. Permission of Instructor required. [3]",

Students will bring multiple forms of evidence to bear that frames and provides the rationale and need to focus on the problem, challenge, or phenomenon in the particular organizational context.
