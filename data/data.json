Where does it come from, and can it be cultivated? Is it a hollow notion we simply project to impress potential employers, or is it a valuable civic ideal? Could it be the key to the good life? And in the age of AI, is it an activity that we can (or should) share with machines? This upper-level history seminar explores historical discourse on the concept of creativity in the modern US since 1870 - in fields as disparate as music, science, the arts, industry, and business. Students will read a variety of primary sources exploring creativity since the late 19th-century. Throughout the course, students will design and develop their own research projects related to the history of creativity.",

The course examines problems the transformation of concepts and values, the relationship between social structures and human action, and the problem of individual agency (whether of men or women). The course will introduce you to scholarship that operates at the intersection of the history of ideas, political, legal, and social history. This course is designed to introduce you to history, historiography, and historical methods, especially those employed in the intellectual history. We will look at how historians work, how they define history, as well as a variety of approaches to historical writing.

We'll study the basics of historical writing, research, and historiography, stopping along the way to borrow some theory and research methods from the sociology of collective action. Using this toolkit, students will conclude the course by writing their own original research essay analyzing a historical social movement.

This course will introduce students to the practice of historical research and writing while thinking through the various forms that empire has taken over time and how imperial powers conceptualized sovereignty. From the Roman Empire to early modern European imperialism in the Atlantic World and Indian Ocean World, to contests for imperial control in nineteenth-century Africa and the interwar Middle East, the Soviet Union, and twenty-first century corporations, we will examine how empires across history have been legally constituted and how imperial powers sought to legally justify their claims to sovereignty. Building on this study, students will spend the second half of the semester developing their own independent research projects related to empire and sovereignty. In the process, students will leave the course with the ability to identify and engage with scholarly literature, locate and analyze primary sources, and craft historical arguments.",
